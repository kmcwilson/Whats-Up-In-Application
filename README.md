# What's Up In...


## Description
This is n application for users who are thinking about traveling to a new city in North America. When the user enters the landing page of the site they can type in any city that they wish to visit. Once a city is entered, they will be taken to our second page which will tell them the current weather within that city, the top four news stories and four events that will be occuring in the near future. When the user clicks on the headlines of either the news or the events section, they will be taken to another page that will give them further detail. 

When browsing the second page, the user can type in a new city into the search bar and the information on the page will change to the newly searched destination.
